    <h2>Everyone is doing great!</h2>
    <p>This was built with Parcel by Moses our frontend boss</p>
    <p>A Spirit among us is missing</p>
    <p>Theo and Maks couldn.t stay to the end due to some reasons, hopefully we will all understand how to use parcel to
        deploy apps</p>
    <strong>Cheers from us at BlueDevTech</strong>
